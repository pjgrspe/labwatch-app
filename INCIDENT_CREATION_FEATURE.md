# Alert-to-Incident Creation Feature Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the alert-to-incident creation feature with AI suggestions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Incident Type Interface
**File:** `types/incidents.ts`
- Added `aiSuggestion?: string` field to the Incident interface

### 2. Modified Alert Detail Screen
**File:** `app/(tabs)/alerts/[id].tsx`
- Updated `handleCreateIncident` function to navigate to add-incident modal with alert data
- Passes alert parameters: alertId, alertType, alertMessage, alertSeverity, roomId, roomName, triggeringValue, sensorType, timestamp

### 3. Rewrote Add Incident Modal
**File:** `app/modals/add-incident.tsx`
- **Major Changes:**
  - Converted from edit modal to create incident modal
  - Added alert data prepopulation logic using URL parameters
  - Implemented AI suggestion generation using Gemini API
  - Added room selection dropdown
  - Added AI suggestion field with generate button
  - Fixed infinite loading loop by removing `params` from useCallback dependency
  - Fixed Text component errors by properly handling undefined values

- **Key Features:**
  - **Alert Data Prepopulation**: Automatically fills form with alert information
  - **AI Suggestion Generation**: Contextual suggestions based on incident details
  - **Editable AI Field**: Users can modify generated suggestions
  - **Form Validation**: Maintains existing validation logic

### 4. Updated Edit Incident Modal
**File:** `app/modals/edit-incident.tsx`
- Added AI suggestion field for consistency
- Field is populated when editing existing incidents
- Included in update operations

## Bug Fixes Applied

### Loading Loop Issue
- **Problem**: Infinite re-rendering due to `params` in useCallback dependency
- **Solution**: Removed `params` from dependency array in `initializeData` function

### Text Component Errors
- **Problem**: Undefined values being rendered directly in Text components
- **Solution**: Added proper null checks and fallback values:
  - Alert type handling: `params.alertType ? params.alertType.replace(/_/g, ' ') : 'Unknown Alert'`
  - Room display: Proper handling of `building` and `floor` fields
  - Title generation: Safe string interpolation

## Usage Flow

### Creating Incident from Alert
1. Navigate to Alert Details screen
2. Click "Create Incident" button
3. Add Incident modal opens with pre-populated data:
   - Title: Generated from alert type
   - Description: Alert message + triggering value + sensor type
   - Room: Pre-selected from alert
   - Severity: Mapped from alert severity
4. Generate AI suggestions (optional)
5. Edit any fields as needed
6. Submit to create incident

### AI Suggestion Generation
- Uses Gemini API with contextual prompt
- Includes incident details, location, alert information
- Provides immediate actions, safety precautions, follow-up recommendations
- Graceful error handling with fallback messages

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Alert-to-Incident Flow
```
1. Open app in emulator/device
2. Navigate to Alerts tab
3. Select any alert
4. Click "Create Incident" button
5. Verify modal opens with pre-populated data
6. Test AI suggestion generation
7. Complete incident creation
```

### 2. Test AI Suggestion Feature
```
1. In add incident modal, fill out basic details
2. Click "Generate" button in AI suggestion section
3. Verify AI suggestion appears
4. Edit the suggestion
5. Save incident with AI suggestion
```

### 3. Test Edit Incident with AI
```
1. Navigate to existing incident
2. Click edit
3. Verify AI suggestion field is present
4. Modify AI suggestion
5. Save changes
```

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- Gemini API integration via `@/APIkeys`
