# Alternative APK Build Instructions

Since the automated build is having dependency conflicts, here are manual steps to create your Android APK:

## Option 1: Using Android Studio (Recommended)

### Prerequisites:
1. Download and install Android Studio from https://developer.android.com/studio
2. Install Android SDK (API 34 or higher)
3. Set up ANDROID_HOME environment variable

### Steps:
1. Open Android Studio
2. File > Open > Navigate to your project's `android` folder
3. Let Gradle sync complete
4. Build > Generate Signed Bundle/APK
5. Choose APK
6. Create a new keystore or use existing
7. Build Release APK

## Option 2: Using Gradle Command Line

### Prerequisites:
- Java JDK 17 or higher
- Android SDK installed

### Commands:
```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

The APK will be generated in:
`android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

## Option 3: Simplified EAS Build

Let me create a minimal configuration that should work:

### Steps:
1. Remove problematic dependencies temporarily
2. Build with simplified config
3. Re-add dependencies after successful build

## Option 4: Web App Alternative

Since Android builds are failing due to native dependencies, you can deploy as a web app:

```bash
npx expo export --platform web
```

This creates a Progressive Web App (PWA) that works on mobile browsers and can be "installed" like a native app.

## Troubleshooting the Current Issues

The build failures are likely due to:
1. TensorFlow.js native dependencies
2. Camera module conflicts
3. Firebase native SDK issues
4. React Native version compatibility

## Temporary Solution

For immediate deployment, I recommend:
1. Build the web version first
2. Set up Android Studio for native builds
3. Create a simplified version without AI features for testing
